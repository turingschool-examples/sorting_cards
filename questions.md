Questions about this project:


-What are we doing?
something with a deck of cards
guessing the top card
seeing if that guess is right

-What does Round do?
it does a few things:
  1) initialized by the deck and an empty array of guesses
  2)records a guess and stores it in a variable and compares it versus the most recent card drawn
  3)can tell us how many correct guesses there are
  4) can tell us percent of guesses entered that are correct

-How are we referencing methods from other files? Maybe this will be more clear when we learn about scope
-Referencing is still hazy. Where are we referencing attributes, methods, and instances of a class?

-Why am I not able to reference rank in the deck.rb file, if './lib/card' is required, and rank is a method defined in the class?
   aka it only works with rank defined as an attribute and instance variable. why is that?


  -Why does the .sort test (the fourth one in deck_test.rb) take forever to run?
