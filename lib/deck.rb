#---------------------- #for practice:
#   def merge_sort
#     #take a list, like the array @cards
#     @cards
# #     # two big steps in merge_sort
# #     # 1) continuously split the list into halves, until we have several lists with just one item in them
# #         - don't worry if a list contains an odd number, just randomly pick which list to include the item in
# # how many iterations given 5 cards? (then try 'n' cards to engineer a reliable template)
#     @cards.count = 5
#     given_cards = @cards.count
#     loop do
#       all_groups = []
#       group_1 = @cards
#       group_1.each do |group_x|
#         group_(x+1) = [[group_x.take(given_cards / 2)], [group_x.drop(given_cards / 2)]]
#         all_groups << group_(x+1)
#       end
#     #......and on and on until each list only has one element
#       break if all_groups.last.count > 1
#     end
#     # now we should have several groups, with one element in each group.
#     # 2)repeatedly merge pairs of groups until all_paired_groups.count = @cards.count
